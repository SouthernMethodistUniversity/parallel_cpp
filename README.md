# Oâ€™Donnell Data Science and Research Computing Institute Parallel C++ Programming Workshop

This resource is designed to introduce and workshop users through the
fundamental concepts and practical implementations of parallel programming
using C++ standard parallelism and MPI via MPL.

## Overview

Parallel programming is essential for leveraging the power of modern multi-core
processors to improve the performance of applications. This workshop focuses on
teaching parallel programming techniques using C++, a language widely used in
performance-critical applications. It covers essential topics, tools, and
techniques that enable you to write efficient and scalable parallel code.

## Key Topics

1. **Introduction to Parallel Programming:**
   - Understanding the basics of parallel computing.
   - Advantages of parallelism in software development.
   - Overview of parallel hardware and software architectures.

2. **C++17 Parallel Programming:**
   - Use of standard C++ features for parallelism, such as threads, atomic operations, and futures.
   - Introduction to the C++ Standard Library's threading support.

4. **MPI (Message Passing Interface) via MPL:**
   - Introduction to MPI for distributed-memory parallel programming.
   - Using MPI for communication between processes in a parallel program.
   - Examples of MPI programs for understanding communication patterns.

## Getting Started

- Prerequisites: Basic understanding of C++ programming.
- Environment Setup: Guidance on setting up a development environment suitable
for parallel programming, including compiler settings and libraries.
- Example Projects: Hands-on examples provided to practice the concepts
learned.

## Resources

- **Documentation:** Detailed explanations and examples of the concepts
covered.
- **Examples:** Sample code demonstrating the use of parallel constructs in
real-world scenarios.
- **Exercises:** Problems and projects to test your understanding and skills.

## Contribution

This workshop is open for contributions from the community. You can suggest
changes, report issues, or add new content to help enhance the learning
experience.
