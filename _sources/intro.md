# Overview

Welcome to the SMU [Oâ€™Donnell Data Science and Research Computing
Institute](https://www.smu.edu/provost/odonnell-institute) (ODSRCI) workshop on
modern C++ programming! This session is designed for developers and researchers
who want to enhance their skills in high-performance computing by leveraging
the latest features of C++ standard parallelism and the Message Passing
Interface (MPI) using the Message Passing Library (MPL). Throughout this
workshop, participants will gain hands-on experience with C++ standard
parallelism to efficiently execute tasks across multiple threads, optimizing
the use of modern multi-core processors. Additionally, we'll delve into using
MPL to simplify the complexities of MPI programming, enabling efficient
communication between distributed computing nodes. By the end of the workshop,
attendees will have a solid understanding of how to harness these powerful
tools to write scalable and efficient parallel applications.
