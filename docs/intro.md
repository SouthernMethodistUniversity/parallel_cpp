# Overview

Welcome to our workshop on modern C++ programming! This session is designed for
developers and researchers who want to enhance their skills in high-performance
computing by leveraging the latest features of C++ standard parallelism and the
Message Passing Interface (MPI) using the Message Passing Library (MPL).
Throughout this workshop, participants will gain hands-on experience with C++
standard parallelism to efficiently execute tasks across multiple threads,
optimizing the use of modern multi-core processors. Additionally, we'll delve
into using MPL to simplify the complexities of MPI programming, enabling
efficient communication between distributed computing nodes. By the end of the
workshop, attendees will have a solid understanding of how to harness these
powerful tools to write scalable and efficient parallel applications.
